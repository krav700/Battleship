# Battleship
The game of Battleships!

In this iteration of the game a player can choose between playing against a frined in the same room and passing the same laptop/turning the monitor or play against a computer.

After starting the game just click on the tiles and if you hit a ship you can continue attacking until striking dead water!

After every game or in the middle of one the player can reset everything or just switch the gamemode.
